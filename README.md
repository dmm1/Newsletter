# Welcome to the Newsletter Project!

Newsletter is an extension for the famous [Zikula Application Framework](http://www.zikula.org), Version 1.3+. It provides an automatic, configurable and extensible Newsletter for your Zikula Site.

The Newsletter module supports both automatic and manual sending of newsletters to subscribers. It is also possible to save newsletters in archive - accessible or not to site visitors.

Newsletter subscribers and their e-mails adresses are synchronized with Zikula users. That means if a Zikula user subscribes to the Newsletter and edits his account information or deletes his account later, his subscribtion to the Newsletter is automatically edited or removed.

## Installation
- Download and extract the zip package from github.
- Copy the `Newsletter-master` folder into your Zikula's modules folder and rename it to `Newsletter`.
- Go to the Extensions module and click onto install button.
- Once installed, go to the Newsletter admin area.
- Select `Newsletter Settings` and check configuration of your Newsletter.
- You can find the german translation at [the german community repository](https://github.com/zikula-communities/german/tree/module_translation/Newsletter). Download and copy the content of the `Newsletter` folder into your `modules/Newsletter` directory.
